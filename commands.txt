# Format dependencies.yaml
# format-deps command ensures that dependencies.yaml is formatted properly
# and requirements are alphabetically sorted
bazel run @bazel_deps//:parse -- format-deps --overwrite --deps `pwd`/dependencies.yaml

# Adding Maven dependency
# add-dep command adds dependency to dependencies.yaml
# it does NOT regenerate build files tree (third_party/maven/), so do it manually
# <maven_artifact> i.e. com.scireum:sirius-kernel:8.0.1

# WARNING: any comments you had in dependencies.yaml
# would be destroyed by add-dep or format-deps, see:
# https://github.com/johnynek/bazel-deps/issues/137

# Regenerate dependencies
# Run this from the workspace root when you add a new Maven dependency to dependencies.yaml
# This can take a few minutes, depending on how many dependencies there are.
# Usually there is already a folder 'third_party' but if there isn't, comment out loading of //third_party/maven:workspace.bzl in WORKSPACE
bazel run @bazel_deps//:parse -- generate -r `pwd` -s third_party/maven/workspace.bzl -d dependencies.yaml
