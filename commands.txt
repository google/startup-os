# Build every buildable Bazel target
# Run this to ensure that everything still builds, kind of a regression test
# This can take several minutes depending hardware and repo size
bazel query //... | grep -v ^\/\/third_party | xargs bazel build

# Format dependencies.yaml
# format-deps command ensures that dependencies.yaml is formatted properly
# and requirements are alphabetically sorted
bazel run @bazel_deps//:parse -- format-deps --overwrite --deps `pwd`/dependencies.yaml

# Adding Maven dependency
# add-dep command adds dependency to dependencies.yaml
# it does NOT regenerate build files tree (third_party/maven/), so do it manually
# <maven_artifact> i.e. com.scireum:sirius-kernel:8.0.1
bazel run @bazel_deps//:parse -- add-dep --deps `pwd`/dependencies.yaml --lang java <maven_artifact>

# WARNING: any comments you had in dependencies.yaml
# would be destroyed by add-dep or format-deps, see:
# https://github.com/johnynek/bazel-deps/issues/137

# Regenerate dependencies
# Run this when you add a new Maven dependency to dependencies.yaml
# This can take a few minutes, depending on how many dependencies there are.
# <root_workspace> should be absolute path rather than relative, so use `pwd` instead of '.'
# Usually there is already a folder 'third_party' but if there isn't, comment out loading of //third_party/maven:workspace.bzl in WORKSPACE
bazel run @bazel_deps//:parse -- generate -r <root_workspace> -s third_party/maven/workspace.bzl -d dependencies.yaml
