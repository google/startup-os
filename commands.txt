# Adding Maven dependency
# add-dep command adds dependency to dependencies.yaml

# Regenerate dependencies
# Run this from the workspace root when you add a new Maven dependency to dependencies.yaml
# This can take a few minutes, depending on how many dependencies there are.
# Usually there is already a folder 'third_party' but if there isn't, comment out loading of //third_party/maven:workspace.bzl in WORKSPACE
