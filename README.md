StartupOS is a setup that helps startups and enterprise teams with setting up their development toolchain and deploying to the cloud.

##### StartupOS includes
* Google's open source libraries and tools, integrated together
* Easy Cloud setup and deployment
* Ready-to-run examples of Android and iOS native apps and Angular web apps.

* Later milestones will add more goodies such as [j2objc](https://developers.google.com/j2objc), [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger) and [Kubernetes](kubernetes.io).

We develop on Ubuntu and Mac. For other OSs - YMMV
