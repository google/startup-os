# are already installed and the build can start running right away. It also guarantees
# the environment is portable and reproducible on your local machine.

# CircleCI lets us pick the key for storing one or more caches, to speed up subsequent builds.
# We can use this to avoid re-fetching our dependencies from npm on every build.
# To ensure we don't load a stale cache, we invalidate it based on the entries in the key:
# - the checksum of Yarn's lock file
# - the branch we are on, which really shouldn't be needed since the yarn lock file should be hermetic
# - the docker image tag, working around an issue we saw where changing docker images causes permission
#   errors when restoring the cache, like when the user we run as changes

# After checkout, rebase on top of master, because we want to test the proposed merge of a
